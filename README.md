macjava
=======

MacJava adds the J to MVC! MacJava is an extension to ASP.NET MVC that provides easy to use JavaScript code inclusion and bundling.

To start using MacJava, add it to your project using NuGet (coming soon), then structure your Scripts directory as you would your Views directory. Then, including JavaScript code is as easy as calling:
@JavaScript.Action("MyScriptName", "MyDirectoryName")

MacJava is currently in alpha development. Although it is safe enough for use in your code, it is still a little rough around the edges, and lacking some features.
